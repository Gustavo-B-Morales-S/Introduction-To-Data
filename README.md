# **_Introduction To Data_**

This repository serves as my **Personal Learning Journey** in the realm of **Data engineering**. It's a space where I document and store what I've learned and accomplished as an _aspiring data specialist_. Feel free to **explore** and follow along with my **progress**.

This repository has my practical application of a basic introduction in **Data Engineering Process**, using the **Python** language as
a base tool along with the pandas library for viewing and filtering data and **RDBMS PostgreSQL** for creating tables and inserting values using **SQL Queries**
